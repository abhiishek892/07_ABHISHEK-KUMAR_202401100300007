Health risk classification is a crucial task in preventive healthcare analytics. Using patient-related data, we aim to categorize individuals into various risk levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on key features such as age, weight, smoking habits, or other indicators. This classification can help in prioritizing medical attention and improving health outcomes. In this project, we use a machine learning model to perform classification based on provided health data. We evaluate the model using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and visualize the results using a confusion matrix heatmap.
The approach involves the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Load and inspect the dataset, separate features and labels.
2. Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and test sets (80-20 ratio).
3. Model Training: Use a Random Forest Classifier to learn patterns from the training data.
4. Prediction: Predict the health risk levels for the test data.
5. Evaluation: Calculate performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
6. Visualization: Generate a heatmap of the confusion matrix to visualize model performance.
